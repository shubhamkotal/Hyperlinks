Linear interpretation:


Exactly! You're interpreting the results correctly.

When the p-value for a coefficient (B1) is very low (less than 0.001), it indicates that the probability of seeing the observed effect (the relationship between B1 and Y) by chance is extremely low.

In this case, the null hypothesis (B1 = 0) is rejected, suggesting that:

- There is a statistically significant relationship between B1 and Y.
- Changes in B1 are associated with changes in Y.

The low p-value indicates that if B1 were actually zero (no relationship), it's highly unlikely to observe the relationship we see. Therefore, we can conclude that B1 has a significant effect on Y.

The coefficient value (B1) itself represents the change in Y for a one-unit change in B1, while holding all other variables constant. A non-zero B1 value indicates that changes in B1 are associated with changes in Y.

So, to summarize:

- Low p-value (< 0.001) indicates a significant relationship between B1 and Y.
- Non-zero B1 value indicates the direction and magnitude of the relationship.

Great job interpreting the results!

When I said "Y is expected to increase by 2.5 units", I was referring to the change in Y, not the absolute value of Y.

To get the absolute value of Y, you would need to add the intercept (also known as the constant or bias term) to the product of the coefficient and the change in X.

So, the correct interpretation would be:

- For every 1-unit increase in X, Y is expected to increase by 2.5 units, assuming all other variables remain constant.
- The new value of Y would be: Intercept + (B1 x new value of X)

For example, if the intercept is 10 and B1 = 2.5, then:

- If X increases by 1 unit, Y is expected to increase by 2.5 units.
- The new value of Y would be: 10 + (2.5 x new value of X)

Thank you for pointing this out, and I hope this clarifies the interpretation!
