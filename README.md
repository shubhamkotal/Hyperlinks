AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is a tool used to compare different models to see which one is better at predicting outcomes, while also considering how complex the model is.

### Simple Example:
Imagine you’re trying to guess someone’s age based on their height and weight.

1. Model 1: You use only height to predict age.
2. Model 2: You use both height and weight to predict age.

- Model 2 might predict better because it has more information (both height and weight).
- But, Model 2 is also more complex because it uses an extra variable (weight).

### How AIC Works:
- AIC looks at how well each model predicts the age (how close the guesses are to the actual age).
- AIC also adds a penalty for complexity (using more variables).

Lower AIC is better because it means the model predicts well without being unnecessarily complicated.

So, if Model 2 has a lower AIC than Model 1, it suggests that using both height and weight is worth the extra complexity. If Model 1 has a lower AIC, it means height alone is good enough, and adding weight doesn’t help much.
